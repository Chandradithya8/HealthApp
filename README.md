## DISCLAIMER ‚ö†Ô∏è

This is a POC(Proof of concept) kind-of project. The data used here comes up with no guarantee from the creator. So, don't use it for making real time disease prediction. If you do so, the creator is not responsible for anything. However, this project presents the idea that how we can use ML/DL into disease prediction if developed at large scale and with authentic and verified data.
## DATASET DETAILS  üìä

Most of the datasets are uploaded in the "Dataset" folder except Covid Disease dataset(15gb).

Heart Disease Dataset - Dataset/heart.csv

Diabetes Dataset - Dataset/diabetes.csv

Kidney Disease Dataset - Dataset/kidney_disease.csv

Liver Disease Dataset - Dataset/indian_liver_patient.csv

Cancer Disease Dataset - Dataset/breast_disease.csv

Covid Disease Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge


## NOTEBOOK DETAILS üìì

All the notebooks are uploaded in the "Notebooks" folder.

Heart Disease  - Notebooks/heart_disease_prediction.ipynb

Diabetes Disease - Notebooks/Diabetes_prediction.ipynb

Kidney Disease  - Notebooks/kidney_disease_prediction.ipynb

Liver Disease  - Notebooks/Liver_disease_prediction.ipynb

Cancer Disease  - Notebooks/cancer_disease_prediction.ipynb

Covid Disease  - Notebooks/coivd_disease_prediction.ipynb

You can view all the saved models (pickle files) in the "Saved_models" folder.

## RUN LOCALLY

Clone the project

```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/Chandradithya8/HealthApp.git
```

Open command prompt and go to the project directory

```bash
  $ cd HealthApp-master
```
When you type "dir" in the command prompt you should see the following files

- Dataset
- Notebooks
- Saved_models
- healthapp
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- LICENSE
- requirements.txt
 

Install dependencies

```bash
  $ pip install requirements.txt
```

Go to the "healthapp" folder

```bash
  $ cd healthapp
```

Start the server
```bash
  $ python manage.py runserver
```
Then you will be able to use the application on your localhost.

## FUTURE PLANS üìà

- In this project I have added around 6 disease prediction models. In the future I will try to add even more disease prediction models for diseases like malaria, pneumonia, etc.
